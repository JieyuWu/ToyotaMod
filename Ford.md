# Important Information

This brand currently has limited openpilot support on the F150 and Fusion only through community maintained branches. Safety code is not working properly and should **NOT** be used without fully understanding the ramifications of such. 

Ford currently has a steering lockout on the PSCM, and after 10 seconds, commands will drop for approximately 200-300ms. A fix has not yet been implemented. 

# Community Branches

The following members currently have Ford code. All code listed here is WIP and not expected to work 100%

# openpilot Capabilities

## Lateral Control

Control over the steering wheel.

Vehicles without LKAS can use openpilot, so long as the LKAS Enable bit is changed in the PSCM with Forscan. This will throw a recurring DTC for a missing IPMA, but will not show up on the IPC. 
Ford currently has a steering lockout on the PSCM, and after 10 seconds, commands will drop for approximately 200-300ms. A fix has not yet been implemented. 

### Torque

### Minimum Speeds
Lateral Control is tied to the Cruise Control. On non Stop/Go vehicles, Lateral stops at 12mph, and can be manually engaged above 20mph. 
On Stop/Go vehicles, Lateral stops at 10mph. 

## Longitudinal Control

Control over the gas and brakes.

Most Ford/Lincoln vehicles do not support OP Longitudinal Control. The CCM on these vehicles (Non Stop/Go) interfaces directly with the HS2 CAN bus and cannot be intercepted. These vehicles run in Lateral Only mode. 

Stop/Go Ford's can be intercepted, but this has not been tested.
