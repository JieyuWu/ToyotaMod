# Before You Start
1. Ensure SSH is on in the settings of your comma two. Found in `Settings -> Developer -> Enable SSH`
2. If you have entered a GitHub username in `Settings -> Developer -> GitHub Username` you must use the private key of a public key saved in your GitHub settings, see [ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai/) for details.  It is highly recommended that new users **not** enter a GitHub Username.  

# Beginner
## Option 1 - Workbench
[Workbench for Openpilot](https://github.com/jfrux/workbench#getting-started)
Workbench is a user-friendly desktop application for SSH ([Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) into your android device running openpilot.

## Option 2 - Putty SSH Client
Using Putty will not provide any of the rich feature set found in workbench.  However, if ssh access is all you need, Putty is a simple beginner friendly way to achieve that.
1. Download and install Putty.
2. Download and save the [Putty Private Key](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa.ppk) `Note, Putty uses a different private key format than OpenSSH.  Do not use this key file with OpenSSH`
3. Get the IP address of your EON/C2 in settings under `Settings > WiFi > Advanced` (Please make sure your EON and your computer connect to the same WiFi)
4. At this point you can optionally check that your computer and device can communicate by doing the following:

* In a terminal try to ping device IP address, such as `ping 192.168.1.100`
* If the devices can connect on the network you should see a response similar to:

```
PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.710 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=13.899 ms
```

5. Open Putty, and enter your device's IP address and change the port to 8022:

6. Load the private key file in `Connection > SSH > Auth > Private key for authentication`:

![Putty Private Key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/86837824-54c1e300-c054-11ea-9b61-fdbfefa8e834.png)

7. Finally, click `Open` on the bottom of the program, and if all works correctly, an SSH connection will be created.

# Advanced
This section assumes that you have used SSH before.  If you want to use Putty, use [the instructions above](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/SSH#option-2---putty-ssh-client).  

## OpenSSH or Similar Client
1. Download the private key [from the openpilot repo.](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa). Save the key file as a text file and name it something like key.pem.
2. Open a terminal
3. Run `$ chmod 600 key.pem` (otherwise the system will think the text file is not safe).
4. Get the IP address of your comma two from `Settings > WiFi > Open WiFi Settings > More Options > Options (top right icon) > Advanced` (please make sure your comma two and your computer connect to the same WiFi).
5. Ping the device address from your computer to make sure it is reachable.
6. Under a Unix/Linux, macOS terminal or Windows 10 with OpenSSH, use the command:

```
$ssh root@<IP address of comma two> -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

Example:
```
$ ssh root@192.168.1.100 -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

# Troubleshoot SSH Issues

## When SSH is automatically enabled/disabled
**WiFi**\
SSH is automatically enabled with a clean comma 2 factory reset. It is disabled once you start installing dashcam or custom software. You then will need to enable SSH through the phone's UI settings if you want to SSH after install. SSH'ing into the phone before installing software (and typing `tmux a`) is helpful in understanding what is going on if you are having trouble performing your install.\
\
**LTE**\
You can always SSH via the LTE connection. Follow the guide here: [https://ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai)

## Invalid Format when trying to connect
Something is wrong with your private key.  Again, Putty and OpenSSH private keys are in different formats, make sure you are using the correct one.

## No route to host
The IP address to your device is wrong in some way.  Are both your computer and device on the same network, is the IP address typed correctly?

## Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)
This is a generic authentication error and could mean many things.  Did you enable SSH on the device?  If you entered a GitHub Username, did you use a private key that matches one in your GitHub account? Did you correctly download and save the private key file?  Does the private key have the correct permissions?
