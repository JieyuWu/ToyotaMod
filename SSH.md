## Beginner
[Workbench for Openpilot](https://github.com/jfrux/workbench#getting-started)
Workbench is a user-friendly desktop application for SSH (Secure Shell) into your android device running openpilot.
 

## Advanced
You can download the id_rsa key [from the openpilot repo.](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa) With that key, you can SSH in as root on port 8022. If you're using [PuTTY](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY), use [this file.](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa.ppk)

Just save the above key as a text file, name it "key.pem" or anything you like;

1) Under Unix/Linux environment, or Mac terminal, please run: $ chmod 600 key.pem (otherwise the system will think the text file is not safe).

2) To connect to your comma two using this key, save the text above to a blank text file and name the file key.pem. (Just make save it into the same working directory, to check using commands `pwd` and `ls`.

Then get the IP address of your comma two in settings under settings > wifi > advanced (please make sure your comma two and your computer connect to the same WiFi).

3) To check your connection: $ ping the comma two IP address, like `ping 192.168.1.100`; please try a couple of times until you see the data exchanging. like: 
```
PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1) 56 data bytes 
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.710 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=13.899 ms
```

4) Under a Linux, MAC machine or PuTTY environment, use the command:

```
$ssh root@<IP address of comma two> -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

Example:
```
$ ssh root@192.168.1.100 -p 8022 -i key.pem
```
