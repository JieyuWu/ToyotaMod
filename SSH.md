# Before You Start
1. Ensure SSH is on in the settings of your comma two. Found in `Settings -> Developer -> Enable SSH`
2. If you have entered a GitHub username in `Settings -> Developer -> GitHub Username` you must use the private key of a public key saved in your GitHub settings, see [ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai/) for details.  It is highly recommended that new users not enter a GitHub Username.  

# Beginner
## Option 1 - Workbench
[Workbench for Openpilot](https://github.com/jfrux/workbench#getting-started)
Workbench is a user-friendly desktop application for SSH ([Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) into your android device running openpilot.

## Option 2 - Putty SSH Client
Using Putty will not provide any of the rich feature set found in workbench.  However, if ssh access is all you need, Putty is a simple beginner friendly way to achieve that.
1. Download and install Putty.
2. Download and save the [Putty Private Key](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa.ppk) `Note, Putty uses a different private key format than OpenSSH.  Do not use this key file with OpenSSH`
3. Get the IP address of your EON/C2 in settings under `Settings > WiFi > Advanced` (Please make sure your EON and your computer connect to the same WiFi)
4. At this point you can optionally check that your computer and device can communicate by doing the following:

* In a terminal try to ping device IP address, such as `ping 192.168.1.100`
* If the devices can connect on the network you should see a response similar to:

```
PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.710 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=13.899 ms
```

5. Open Putty, and enter your device's IP address and change the port to 8022:

6. Load the private key file in `Connection > SSH > Auth > Private key for authentication`:

![Putty Private Key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/86837824-54c1e300-c054-11ea-9b61-fdbfefa8e834.png)

7. Finally, click `Open` on the bottom of the program, and if all works correctly, an SSH connection will be created.

# Advanced
You can download the id_rsa key [from the openpilot repo.](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa) With that key, you can SSH in as root on port 8022. If you're using [PuTTY](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY), use [this file.](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa.ppk)

Make sure you have **not** added any GitHub usernames to your comma two Authorized SSH Keys, then, under Unix/Linux environment, or macOS terminal:

1) Save the key file above as a text file and name it something like key.pem

2) Run $ chmod 600 key.pem (otherwise the system will think the text file is not safe).

Then get the IP address of your comma two from `Settings > WiFi > Open WiFi Settings > More Options > Options (top right icon) > Advanced` (please make sure your comma two and your computer connect to the same WiFi).

3) To check your connection: $ ping the comma two IP address, like `ping 192.168.1.100`; please try a couple of times until you see the data exchanging. like: 
```
PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1) 56 data bytes 
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.710 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=13.899 ms
```

4) Under a Unix/Linux, macOS terminal or PuTTY environment, use the command:

```
$ssh root@<IP address of comma two> -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

Example:
```
$ ssh root@192.168.1.100 -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

### tmux
Once you are ssh'd into the device, you can monitor openpilot outputs with tmux\
`tmux a` to attach to tmux window\
`` ` + d`` to exit tmux window (this is changed from the default `ctrl-b + d`)

### When SSH is automatically enabled/disabled
**WiFi**\
SSH is automatically enabled with a clean comma 2 factory reset. It is disabled once you start installing dashcam or custom software. You then will need to enable SSH through the phone's UI settings if you want to SSH after install. SSH'ing into the phone before installing software (and typing `tmux a`) is helpful in understanding what is going on if you are having trouble performing your install.\
\
**LTE**\
You can always SSH via the LTE connection. Follow the guide here: [https://ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai)
