# Before You Start
1. Ensure SSH is on in the settings of your comma two. Found in `Settings -> Developer -> Enable SSH`
2. If you have entered a GitHub username in `Settings -> Developer -> GitHub Username` you must use the private key of a public key saved in your GitHub settings, see [ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai/) for details.  It is highly recommended that new users **not** enter a GitHub Username.

# Beginner
## Option 1 - Workbench
[Workbench for Openpilot](https://github.com/jfrux/workbench#getting-started)
Workbench is a user-friendly desktop application for SSH ([Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) into your android device running openpilot.

## Option 2 - Putty SSH Client
Using Putty will not provide any of the rich feature sets found in workbench.  However, if ssh access is all you need, Putty is a simple beginner friendly way to achieve that.
1. Download and install Putty.
2. Download and save the [Putty Private Key](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa.ppk) `Note; Putty uses a different private key format than OpenSSH.  Do not use this key file with OpenSSH`
3. Get the IP address of your EON/C2 in settings under `Settings > WiFi > Open WiFi Settings > More Options > Three Dots in Top Left > Advanced` (Please make sure your EON and your computer connect to the same WiFi)
4. At this point you can optionally check that your computer and device can communicate by doing the following:

* In a terminal try to ping device IP address, such as `ping 192.168.1.100`
* If the devices can connect on the network you should see a response similar to:

```
PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.710 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=13.899 ms
```

5. Open Putty, and enter the hostname as `root@<ip_address>` where <ip_address> is your device IP and change the port to `8022`:

![Putty Main Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87094708-3561bc00-c1f4-11ea-96c9-0029bda9664e.png)

6. Load the private key file in `Connection > SSH > Auth > Private key for authentication`:

![Putty Private Key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/86837824-54c1e300-c054-11ea-9b61-fdbfefa8e834.png)

7. Finally, click `Open` on the bottom of the program, and if all works correctly, an SSH connection will be created.

# Advanced
This section assumes that you have used SSH before.  If you want to use Putty, use [the instructions above](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/SSH#option-2---putty-ssh-client).  

## OpenSSH or Similar Client
1. Download the private key [from the openpilot repo.](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/tools/ssh/key/id_rsa). Save the key file as a text file and name it something like key.pem.
2. Open a terminal
3. Run `$ chmod 600 key.pem` (otherwise, the system will think the text file is not safe).
4. Get the IP address of your comma two from `Settings > WiFi > Open WiFi Settings > More Options > Options (top right icon) > Advanced` (please make sure your comma two and your computer connect to the same WiFi).
5. Ping the device address from your computer to make sure it is reachable.
6. Under a Unix/Linux, macOS terminal or Windows 10 with OpenSSH, use the command:

```
$ssh root@<IP address of comma two> -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

Example:
```
$ ssh root@192.168.1.100 -p 8022 -i key.pem
```

## Connecting to ssh.comma.ai
### Using OpenSSH
The instructions on [ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai/) for a saved connection are slightly wrong.  If you want to connect to your comma device by typing `ssh comma-{dongleid}` your `~/.ssh/config/` file should read as follows (Note the ${%h} entries in the ProxyCommand):

```
Host comma-*
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_github_key
  ProxyCommand ssh ${%h}@ssh.comma.ai -W ${%h}:%p

Host ssh.comma.ai
  Hostname ssh.comma.ai
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_github_key
```

Better yet, if you just want to connect directly to your vehicle without memorizing your DongleID you can do as follows (replacing <DongleID> with, you know the ID.  You can change the hostname <comma-rav4> to anything) then you can use `ssh comma-rav4`:

```
Host comma-rav4
  Port 22
  ProxyCommand ssh <DongleID>@ssh.comma.ai -W <DongleID>:%p

Host ssh.comma.ai
  Hostname ssh.comma.ai
  Port 22
```

The one time connection listed on [ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai/) works just fine.

### Using Putty to Connect to ssh.comma.ai
Using Putty to connect to ssh.comma.ai is a bit involved.  First, it assumes you have already gotten the direct SSH connection using Putty to work as described [above](#option-2---putty-ssh-client).

1. Start the pageant program (it is found in the same folder as Putty).
2. Pageant will load in your taskbar ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87094964-b456f480-c1f4-11ea-971e-57e4ba63e161.png).  Right click the icon and select View Keys

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87095063-e7998380-c1f4-11ea-9843-474119b4e6bb.png)

3. Click Add Key

4. Locate and select your private key `id_rsa.ppk`
5. After opening the key, you should see it in the key list

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87095343-6ee6f700-c1f5-11ea-8749-6a91d55be424.png)

6. You can click Close (pageant will keep running)
7. Open Putty
8. In the Host Name enter `root@<dongleid>` where <dongleid> is your dongle id and Port `22`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87095535-c08f8180-c1f5-11ea-9e3d-69707f93d306.png)

9. Under `Connection > Proxy` enter the following:
- Proxy type `Local`
- Proxy hostname `ssh.comma.ai`
- Port `22`
- Telnet command or local proxy command `plink.exe -v %host@%proxyhost -nc %host:%port`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87095770-31cf3480-c1f6-11ea-9b42-3a37415d50c1.png)

10. Go back to `Session`
11. Type a name in `Saved Session`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3046315/87095535-c08f8180-c1f5-11ea-9e3d-69707f93d306.png)

12. Click `Save`
13. Click `Open`
14. You may get a few prompts to accept the server fingerprints.

You should not be connected to your device.  If you made any mistakes, you can load the saved session and fix the errors, but be sure to click `Save` after making any changes, or they will not be permanent.

Pageant will keep running until you log off your computer.  You can also exit pageant by right-clicking the taskbar icon and selecting `Exit`.

# Troubleshoot SSH Issues

## When SSH is automatically enabled/disabled
**WiFi**\
SSH is automatically enabled with a clean comma 2 factory reset. It is disabled once you start installing dashcam or custom software. You then will need to enable SSH through the phone's UI settings if you want to SSH after install. SSH'ing into the phone before installing software (and typing `tmux a`) is helpful in understanding what is going on if you are having trouble performing your install.\
\
**LTE**\
You can always SSH via the LTE connection. Follow the guide here: [https://ssh.comma.ai](https://ssh.comma.ai)

## Invalid Format when trying to connect
Something is wrong with your private key.  Again, Putty and OpenSSH private keys are in different formats, make sure you are using the correct one.

## No route to host
The IP address to your device is wrong in some way.  Are both your computer and device on the same network, is the IP address typed correctly?

## Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)
This is a generic authentication error and could mean many things.  Did you enable SSH on the device?  If you entered a GitHub Username, did you use a private key that matches one in your GitHub account? Did you correctly download and save the private key file?  Does the private key have the correct permissions?
