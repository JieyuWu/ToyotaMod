# Harness Guide

Before purchasing a harness for an unsupported vehicle, make sure you are purchasing the correct type. 
### It's important to look where the notches are on your plug side, and ensure they match correctly.

You can find this connector plugged into your Lane-Keep camera which is located near your rear-view mirror. You may need to pull back some trim to expose the camera. Once you do, unplug the connector and compare it to the types below. If it doesn't match, we don't yet sell the correct harness for your vehicle.

# openpilot Capabilities

## Lateral Control

Control over the steering wheel.

For HKG cars that have critical damping (ping pong, oscillation, ziggy zaggies) no matter your settings, PID tuning may not be right for your car.  You can try INDI tuning instead by adding these five lines to your relevant car in `/car/hyundai/interface.py` :

```ret.lateralTuning.init('indi')
ret.lateralTuning.indi.innerLoopGain = 3.0
ret.lateralTuning.indi.outerLoopGain = 2.0
ret.lateralTuning.indi.timeConstant = 1.0
ret.lateralTuning.indi.actuatorEffectiveness = 1.0
```

Comment out the lines containing Kp, Ki and Kf with a # at the beginning of the line.

The above is only a start point, and needs tuning like any variable parameter.  Raise and lower the LoopGain's by 0.1 at a time, both up or down, until your condition improves.  For Stinger and Genesis, the actuatorEffectiveness start point should be 1.5. 

## Longitudinal Control

Control over the gas and brakes.

At the moment, longitudinal control is provided by the stock system that came with the car.
In the future, we will be able to control longitudinally via openpilot for any vehicle whose trims _can_ support SCC, even if not equipped
