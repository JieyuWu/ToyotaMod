### Will the Comma 2 Drain my Car Battery?
> It shouldn't.  The Comma 2 is designed to turn off after 30 hours of inactivity.  That said, some of the 12v batteries used in hybrid vehicles are rather small (they are mainly used to boot up the computers, at which time the large hybrid battery charges the 12v batteries.)  However, if you are concerned about it, you can decrease the inactivity time as described in this [github commit](https://github.com/ErichMoraga/openpilot/commit/180a976266faff336c92f8ff04859bec76918972#diff-40746976e6fa06a3813d9c8adbfe9f9e)
