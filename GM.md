If using ASCM connector stub + cam connector stub, furnish the stubs via soldering.

1) Final ASCM 14-pin connector stub assembled:  

(TBD)

2) Final cam connector stub assembled:

3) Connect a wire from switched +12V (e.g. ignition on) to pin 9 of cam connector. This will turn on the front radar when the car is powered on.
Examples of switched +12V locations:
* Rearview mirror assembly
* Driver footwell fusebox

### Hardware Installation

1) Replace ASCM with one of the 3 ASCM replacements above.
    * If using GM Giraffe, simply swap out the ASCM for the GM Giraffe.
    * If using ASCM wiring harness, connect the harness inline with ASCM and run the wires to the dash.
    * If using ASCM stub connector, disconnect the 14-pin ASCM connector and plug in the stub connector. Leave the 16-pin connector in ASCM plugged in.
2) Install Gray Panda in OBD II port.
    * Install Gray Panda GPS antenna on windshield.
3) Install EON centered on windshield.
    * Run a USB extension cable from Panda -> nearby EON.
    * Use short mini-usb left-angle USB cable from USB extension -> EON.
4) [Enjoy your first drive!](https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/First_OpenPilot_Drive)
