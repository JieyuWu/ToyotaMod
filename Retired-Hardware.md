## White Panda

Last supported op version: 0.7.6.1

If you're stuck with a white Panda, you'll find it useful to downgrade to the last version that supported it...

`cd /data && rm -rf openpilot && git clone -b v0.7.6.1 https://github.com/commaai/openpilot && reboot`

Some forks have attempted to maintain some White Panda support:
