# Communication Issue between Processes过程中的通讯问题
This error can mean a number of things. Essentially, it means not all the right processes are broadcasting to the comma two.
这个错误有很多种可能的原因。
## Common Issues 常见问题

### frontFrame not broadcasting

Rarely, the driver facing camera connector will become loose. When this happens, frontFrame will stop broadcasting - causing the `Communication Issue between Processes` error. Check if your driver facing camera still works by going to `Settings -> Device -> Driver Camera View`.

### Some process not running某些进程未运行

If you are running anything but `release2` on your device, it is likely the fork maintainer missed something - or has an error in their DBC file. A good way to check is to SSH into your device and type `tmux a`如果你使用的是除release2版本外的其他分支版本，可能是作者遗漏了什么，或者他们的DBC文件中有错误，最好的检查办法就是通过SSH连接你的设备，执行语句tmux a来查看状态。

## CAN Error   CAN信号错误

There are some message that the device is not receiving properly. Usually this is resolved by fixing a loose connection.

See [Fixing a Connection Issue]设备没有接收到某些信息。一般可以通过固定松动的连接线来解决。

请参阅解决连接问题(https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/Troubleshooting#fixing-a-connection-issue)

## Radar Communication Issue雷达通讯问题

This means the CAN bus that the radar sits on is not being received properly, which often means there is a loose cable somewhere.

See [Fixing a Connection Issue]这意味着无法正确接收雷达所在的CAN总线，这通常意味着某处电缆松动。

请参阅解决连接问题(https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/Troubleshooting#fixing-a-connection-issue)

## Harness Box Error线束盒错误

Similar to a radar error, this means that a CAN bus is not being received by the device.

See [Fixing a Connection Issue]与雷达错误类似，这意味着设备未接收到CAN总线。

请参阅解决连接问题(https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/Troubleshooting#fixing-a-connection-issue)

# Hardware  硬件

## Fixing a Connection Issue解决连接问题

Disconnect and reconnect every connector from every plug. Ensure each plug is firmly seated in its respective connector. Do this for everything! The comma power v2, the harness box, and the ODB-C cable to the comma two.
If the error still persists, try flipping the ODB-C connection on the comma two. Sometimes the device will only accept all data lines from a certain direction of ODB-C.

If this doesn't fix the issue, it is possible to purchase replacement cables and A-B compare them to the included ones.
断开并重新连接每个插头上的每个连接器。确保每个插头牢固地插入其各自的连接器中。确保做到逗号电源v2，线束盒和ODB-C电缆连接到C2。

如果错误仍然存​​在，请尝试以逗号2翻转ODB-C连接。有时，设备将只接受来自ODB-C特定方向的所有数据线。

如果这不能解决问题，则可以购买备用电缆，并将AB与随附的电缆进行比较。

### EON discharges during use, or charges slowly EON在使用过程中会放电或缓慢充电

Get a better USB cable: thicker gauge and shorter length. The Panda outputs 5V, but due to resistance in the cable, there is voltage drop to the point where the EON cannot charge effectively.
买质量好点的USB数据线：粗一点的，短一点的。熊猫输出5V的点，但是由于电缆中的电阻，电压会下降到EON无法有效充电的程度。
### Errors Relating to CAN or Not Detecting Ignition与CAN有关的错误或未检测到点火
For a cable to work, it must have all pins present. The only specs that do are **USB-C 3.1 Gen 2** or **USB-C with Thunderbolt**.
Cables below are recommended and confirmed to work. We ship with a 1.5ft cable for most harnesses, or a 3 meter cable on Nissan and OBD-II harnesses.一条有用的数据线，必须是满针的。唯一可以用的的规格是USB-C 3.1 Gen 2或具有Thunderbolt的USB-C。建议并确认下面的电缆可以工作。对于大多数线束，我们随附1.5英尺电缆，对于日产和OBD-II线束，我们随附3米电缆。

If none of this resolves the issue, it is most likely a bad harness box. Email support@comma.ai for further assistance, listing the things you tried.如果这些都不能解决问题，则很可能是线束盒损坏。电子邮件support@comma.ai以获得进一步的帮助，列出您尝试过的事情。

## Rebooting Device / Stuck on Comma Logo重新启动设备/卡在逗号徽标上
Very rarely, the comma device can get corrupted during an update or by being unplugged without proper shut down.

This is usually fixed by reflashing the NEOS operating system back onto the device.

A guide on how to do this is here for Windows, Mac, or Linux. https://github.com/commaai/eon-neos#restoring-on-linuxos-x

If that still doesn't work, or if the device continues to reboot while in 'fastboot' mode, email support@comma.ai with your troubleshooting steps.
极少数情况下，逗号设备可能会在更新过程中损坏，或者在没有适当关闭的情况下被拔出插头。

通常可以通过将NEOS操作系统重新刷回到设备上来解决此问题。

适用于Windows，Mac或Linux的操作指南在此处。https://github.com/commaai/eon-neos#restoring-on-linuxos-x

如果仍然无法正常工作，或者设备在“快速启动”模式下继续重新启动，请发送电子邮件至support@comma.ai并提供故障排除步骤。
## 'No Vehicle' on comma two

This is caused by the UNO board failing to communicate with the phone inside the comma device. `Note: this is always expected when the comma device is powered outside the car.`

If the comma device is plugged into the car harness, please proceed.

**1. Reboot the comma device a few times**

> Sometimes the device needs to be rebooted a few times to flash the internal UNO board. Did this fix the issue?

_If you're running on a fork, you may have to SSH into your comma two and run `make recover` in `cd /data/openpilot/panda/board`_

**2. Run SSH commands to reset the UNO board**

> There is a guide on how to SSH here: https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/SSH If you are still stuck, you can ask for help on discord.comma.ai.

`cd /data/openpilot`

`PYTHONPATH=/data/openpilot python -c 'from selfdrive.thermald.thermald import setup_eon_fan, set_eon_fan; setup_eon_fan(); set_eon_fan(3);'`

> When these commands are run, this error is expected and can be ignored. 'sh: can't create /sys/module/dwc3_msm/parameters/otg_switch: Permission denied'

`PYTHONPATH=/data/openpilot python -c 'from selfdrive.thermald.thermald import setup_eon_fan, set_eon_fan; setup_eon_fan(); set_eon_fan(0);'`

**3. Email support**

If those commands still don't solve the issue after a device reboot, email support@comma.ai with your order # and your troubleshooting steps.

## EON Fan Constantly Running

SSH into your device, and attempt to manually control the fan using this command.

```cd /data/openpilot && PYTHONPATH=/data/openpilot python -c 'from selfdrive.thermald.thermald import setup_eon_fan, set_eon_fan; setup_eon_fan(); set_eon_fan(1);' ```

The value in the set_eon_fan function is the fan speed, anywhere between 0 and 3 (zero being off and 3 being the highest). Start with setting 1 and then set 0. (You will get a message about permission denied but the command still runs)

If your fan turns off when setting it to 0, then it is working properly. If it remains on, then you need a replacement fan module.

# Advanced Debugging
First [SSH into your device](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/SSH).  Once you are ssh'd into the device, you can monitor openpilot outputs with tmux\
`tmux a` to attach to tmux window\
`` ` + d`` to exit tmux window (this is changed from the default `ctrl-b + d`)
