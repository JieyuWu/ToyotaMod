# Install Locations

The Nissan harness needs to be plugged into the ADAS module (NOT the lane keep assist camera). This module can be in a wide range of locations, which is why the comma two ships with a 3 meter long USB-C cable.

Below are locations the community has found for their cars. Please note, if your car isn't below you will need to locate the ADAS module.

It is just above the glove box location once removed. The picture is taken with the camera pointed up into the cavity not directly head on.

There is no need to disassemble anything. All you need is to remove the luggage floor cover, and expose the spare tire. The ADAS could be reach by hand, and the user disconnected the harness wire with min efforts. This may require a USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 extender to reach the comma two.
