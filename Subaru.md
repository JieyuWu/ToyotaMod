### Minimum speeds

0 mph minimum speed for lateral control

### Stop and go support

Eyesight ACC stops the car, and on supported models<sup>1</sup> will engage brake hold for up to 2 minutes, after which, the park brake will be engaged. *Resuming ACC is a manual operation at this time. Automatic resume is not implemented yet.*
