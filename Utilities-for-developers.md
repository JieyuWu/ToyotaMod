| <img src="https://emu.bz/Jmx" alt="Openpilot Tools" style="width:400px;height:auto" /> | [Openpilot Tools](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools) - The official development tools provided by comma.ai 
| <img src="https://emu.bz/nTT" alt="workbench"  style="width:400px;height:auto" /> | [jfrux/workbench](https://github.com/jfrux/workbench) - Electon-based react application that interfaces with your eon/comma two over SSH, and can provide live data feeds, automatic device detection on the network, and command-line utilities. This repository is under-maintained, someone should fork it and fix it up a bit to keep it alive! |
| <img src="https://emu.bz/UZR" alt="" style="width:400px;height:auto" /> | [emu-sh/.oh-my-comma](https://github.com/emu-sh/.oh-my-comma) command-line utilities, themeing, and tooling for neos that live entirely on the device. Early in development, but could be promising with enough community support. |
