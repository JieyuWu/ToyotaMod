Below is a list of utilities that developers and power-users can use for improving the ease-of-use with interfacing with your comma hardware and software.


* [jfrux/workbench](https://github.com/jfrux/workbench) - Electon-based react application that interfaces with your eon/comma two over SSH, and can provide live data feeds, automatic device detection on the network, and command-line utilities. This repository is under-maintained, someone should fork it and fix it up a bit to keep it alive!

* [AskAlice/.oh-my-comma](https://github.com/askalice/.oh-my-comma) command-line utilities, themeing, and tooling for neos that live entirely on the device. Early in development, but could be promising with enough community support.
